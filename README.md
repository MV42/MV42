## Evolution Of The Repo
I'd like to make it not only the storage of my piscine, but the reference for the Piscine projects.
I know this may sound stupid as I only got to C07, but I always was long searching for ways to improve my implementations, by making it with the lowest line count, less operations, fastest, cleanest, more energy efficient why not...
I did not manage to make it most of the time because I like to take my time (maybe too much) to make something perfect but end up being caught by the deadline and giving up my optimizations goals.

So when I will not be on edge of Blackhole anymore and have more time, MAYBE i'll try to work on the optimal code for each Piscine projects (and after that Common Core projects maybe) but for that I'll need to make my own unique tester to measure the optimizations metrics enumerated before.
